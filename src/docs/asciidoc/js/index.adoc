= NetRelay^(R)^ Controller


This project is an extension of the project NetRelay and contains several implementations of
`IController`, which are ready to be used, configurable and cover lot of use
cases.

To understand and to use those implementations you should be familar with the use of NetRelay.

For basic information about NetRelay go to the https://github.com/BraintagsGmbH/NetRelay[ NetRelay documentation ]

If you are searching for a very quick entry into NetRelay with a prepared, ready to use project based on NetRelay,
you should go to link:https://github.com/BraintagsGmbH/NetRelay-Demoproject[ Quickstart with NetRelay-Demoproject]

== Controllers

Description of the function of existing controllers.

More detailed information about the configuration parameters,
return values etc. can be found inside the javadoc of the corresponding implementation.

=== `CurrentMemberController`
If a user is logged in, the corresponding record is fetched from the datastore and placed into the context with the
property . From there the instance can be
accessed by other controllers like the `ThymeleafTemplateController`.

[source, json]
----
{
"name" : "CurrentMemberController",
"routes" : null,
"blocking" : false,
"failureDefinition" : false,
"controller" : "de.braintags.netrelay.controller.CurrentMemberController",
"httpMethod" : null,
"handlerProperties" : { },
"captureCollection" : null
}
----

=== `ProtocolController`
The ProtocolController forces the use of a certain protocol, like https for instance, for the defined routes. If for
a fitting route the required protocol is not used, a redirect will be sent

[source, json]
----
{
"name" : "ProtocolController",
"routes" : [ "/checkout/*", "/backend/*", "/myAccount/*" ],
"blocking" : false,
"failureDefinition" : false,
"controller" : "de.braintags.netrelay.controller.ProtocolController",
"handlerProperties" : {
"protocol" : "https",
"port" : "647"
},
}
----

=== `RedirectController`
The RedirectController redirects fitting routes to the page specified by property



[source, json]
----
{
"name" : "RedirectController",
"routes" : [ "/" ],
"controller" : "de.braintags.netrelay.controller.RedirectController",
"handlerProperties" : {
"destination" : "/index.html"
},
}
----

=== `ThymeleafTemplateController`
This controller is used to process templates based on the template engine Thymeleaf

[source, json]
----
{
"name" : "ThymeleafTemplateController",
"routes" : [ "/*" ],
"controller" : "de.braintags.netrelay.controller.ThymeleafTemplateController",
"handlerProperties" : {
"templateDirectory" : "templates",
"mode" : "XHTML",
"contentType" : "text/html",
"cacheEnabled" : "false"
}
}
----

=== `VirtualHostController`
The VirtualHostController integrates the VirtualHostHandler from vertx. Like that it will verify, wether the hostname
of a request matches the defined hostName parameter. If so, it will send a redirect to the defined destination with
the defined http code.


[source, json]
----
{
"name" : "VirtualHostController",
"routes" : null,
"controller" : "de.braintags.netrelay.controller.VirtualHostController",

"hostName" : "127.0.0.1",
"destination" : "http://localhost",
"appendPath" : "true"
},
"captureCollection" : null
}

=== Authentication and registration
This package contains several controllers, which can be used to configure and use the complete process of
authentication, authorization ( permissions ), registration etc.

==== `AuthenticationController`
This controller performs authentication ( login / logout ) and authorization ( permission handling, role access,
action access etc. ).

All routes, which are covered by this controller are protected. The controller takes
automatically care about login and logout of users. Please read further documentation inside the javadoc of the
controller.

The configuration below protects all urls starting with /backend/system/ and /backend/dashboard/. Access is granted
for users with one of the roles marketing and admin, where marketing has the right to read and update records; admin
has the right to all actions

[source, json]
----
{
"name" : "AuthenticationBackendController",
"routes" : [ "/backend/system/*", "/backend/dashboard/*" ],
"controller" : "de.braintags.netrelay.controller.authentication.AuthenticationController",
"handlerProperties" : {
"loginPage" : "/backend/login.html",
"logoutAction" : "/member/logout",
"roleField" : "roles",
"collectionName" : "Member",
"loginAction" : "/member/login",
"passwordField" : "password",
"usernameField" : "userName",
"authProvider" : "MongoAuth",
"permissions" : "role: marketing{RU}, admin{CRUD}"
}
}
----


The configuration below protects the url /my-account/memberdata for users of any role. Users with the role "user" can
read and update records, users with the role "admin" can handle all actions on records and users with any other role
are only allowed to display records

[source, json]
----
{
"name" : "AuthenticationMemberdataController",
"routes" : [ "/my-account/memberdata" ],

"passwordField" : "password",
"usernameField" : "userName",
"authProvider" : "MongoAuth",
"permissions" : "role: user{RU}, admin{CRUD}, *{R}"
}
}

----



==== `RegisterController`
This controller performs a user registration with an integrated automatic double opt in process.
To use this controller, you will have to create some templates:

* start of the registration process +
This template contains a form, which contains minimal two fields "email" and "password". Additional fields may be
defined by using the same structure than in the PersistenceController, like mapperName.fieldName ( for
example: "customer.lastName" ). The action of the form must point to a route, which is covered by the controller
definition ( here "/customer/doRegister" )

* register start success +
When the user sent the above form and the registration mail could be successfully sent, this template will be called.

* register start failed +
when the user sent the above form and the process could not be started ( cause the email exists already in the system
for instance ), then this template is called. The variable "registerError" contains an error variable.

* registration confirmation mail +
When the above form was sent, an email is sent to the customer, which contains a link, by which the validation is
processed. The link should be created like that ( Thymeleaf syntax): +
`<a th:href="${host}+'/my-account/verifyRegistration?validationId='+${context.get('validationId')}" target="_blank">
reset password</a>`

* registration confirmation success +
When the user clicks the link inside the confirmation mail, the controller tries to finish the process. If this is
successfull, this template will be called

* registration confirmation failed +
When the above process failed, this template will be called


[source, json]
----
{
"name" : "RegisterCustomerController",
"routes" : [ "/customer/doRegister","/my-account/verifyRegistration"],
"controller" : "de.braintags.netrelay.controller.authentication.RegisterController",
"handlerProperties" : {
"regStartFailUrl" : "/my-account/registration.html",
"regStartSuccessUrl" : "/my-account/confirmRegistration.html",
"regConfirmSuccessUrl" : "/my-account/verifyRegistration.html",
"regConfirmFailUrl" : "/my-account/failureRegistration.html",
"templateDirectory" : "templates",
"template": "/mails/verifyEmail.html",
"mode" : "XHTML",
"from" : "service@xxx.com",
"bcc" : "service@xxx.com",
"subject": "Please verify your subscription",
}
}


----


==== `PasswordLostController`
The PasswordLostController is used to manage the process for a user, who doesn't remember his password. The process
integrates automatically double opt in.
To use this controller, you will have to create some templates:

* Activation of password lost +
This template contains a form, by which the email adress of the member or customer shall be sent. The address of the
form will be something like "/customer/passwordLost" - so one of the routes, which are covered by the controller.

* success url password lost
When the user sends the above form, the system tries to find his data and to send a mail with the link to finish the
process. If this was successful, then this template is called

* failed url password lost
if the above process failed for any reason, this template will be called, the property "resetError" contains some
information about the error

* Password lost mail +
The mail, which is sent to the customer, when his data are found, is generated by a template. This mail contains the
confirmation link, which will finish the password lost process. The link should be created like that ( Thymeleaf
syntax): +
`<a th:href="${host}+'/customer/passwordReset?validationId='+${context.get('validationId')}" target="_blank">reset
password</a>`

* Password reset success +
When the user clicks the link inside the confirmation mail, the controller tries to finish the process. If this is
successfull, this template will be called

* Password reset failed +
When the above process failed, this template will be called


[source, json]
----
{
"name" : "PasswordLostController",
"routes" : [ "/customer/passwordLost","/customer/passwordReset"],

"mode" : "XHTML",
"cacheEnabled" : "false",
"from" : "service@xxx.com",
"bcc" : "service@xxx.com",
"subject": "password lost"
}
}


----

=== `PersistenceController`
The PersistenceController is the instance, which translates the parameters and data of a request into a datastore
based action.

A request like "http://localhost/article/detail?ID=5&entity=article" will be interpreted by the
controller to fetch the article with the id 5 from the datastore and to store it inside the context, so that is can
be displayed by a template engine.

The example configuration below defines the Persistence-Controller to be active under the url /article/detail and
will
let run the above described actions.
"http://localhost/article/detail?ID=5&entity=article" will load the article for display,
"http://localhost/article/detail?ID=5&entity=article&actio=DELETE" will delete this article from the datastore

----
{
"name" : "PersistenceController",
"routes" : [ "/article/detail" ],

"controllerKey" : "ID",
"required" : false
}, {
"captureName" : "action",
"controllerKey" : "action",
"required" : false
} ]
} ]
}

----

=== `RequestLoggingController`
This controller logs the request data into the logger and can be used for debugging purpose

----
{
"name" : "RequestLoggingController",
"routes" : [ "/testtemplate/*", "/backend/*" ],
"controller" : "de.braintags.netrelay.controller.logging.RequestLoggingController"
}
----

=== `MailController`
A controller which is sending mails by using the mail client, which is defined by NetRelay.

The
controller can compose the content of the mail by using a static text, which will be set inside the configuration. Or
- if a template is defined by the configuration - the content will be created dynamic.
